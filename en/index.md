Censuses, or population counts, have been conducted in the territory now known as Canada since 1665-66 in New France (Statistics Canada 2015). Canada’s census is our most valuable primary economic, social, and cultural data set, and is an essential research tool for the formation of new knowledge about the populations that lived here in the past and present.

The sources of information that make up the censuses are rich, diverse, and complex. They consist of archival records, publications, and data files, containing a mix of primary data, expert analyses, and supporting documentation. This project is focused on those sources that contain data, and documentation that supports the use of the data.

The Canadian Census Data Discovery Partnership will work towards the following objectives over a two-year period:
1. Complete a comprehensive, bilingual census inventory.
2. Complete a user needs study, which will gather input from stakeholders (both within and beyond the formal partnership) about the functional requirements for a census discovery portal, the design of the inventory metadata model and taxonomies, and opportunities for the future.
3. Design and develop a proof of concept for a Canadian census discovery portal.
4. Complete a series of investigations (white papers) on topics related to the development of a national census infrastructure, which will cumulatively provide a vision for how this project should continue into a future phase.

### Vision

This project aims to inventory all born-print and born-digital statistical tables, detailed data, and mapping products, to the best of our ability, as well as all relevant documentation, for all census years in Canada (pre-Confederation to the present day).

The inventory will be completely bilingual.

The inventory will be at the individual item level, (e.g., a statistical table: “Birthplace by Census Districts”, 1901 Census, 98-1901(F) v.1, table 14), with the intention of eventually creating a searchable census platform that will allow for greatly enhanced discovery of specific variables available across census years. The project will also involve the creation of item-level notes on accessibility and readability of contents in all available formats. As part of the inventory project, the working group will also be drafting a vision document for a future searchable, long-term bilingual Canadian census platform.

### Scope of the Canadian Census Discovery Portal

Some limitations on the scope of the project:

1. **In scope: Only the Census of the “population” of Canada is in scope.**
- Out of scope:
  - Other censuses such as the Census of Agriculture, as well as publications relating to Industry, merchandising, trade, household possessions. Transportation etc. may be included in a future project.  
<br />
2. **In scope: Only Censuses which are “more than” mere population counts are in scope at this time. In other words, Censuses of individual persons and households are in scope.**
- Out of scope:
  - As some very early local population “counts” did not include details about individuals, these are excluded.  
<br />
3. **In scope: Only contents specifically released as “part of” a census are in scope at this time.**
- Out of scope:
  - Post-census surveys such as the Aboriginal Peoples Survey,
annual (intercensal) population estimates, population projections, and secondary level sources which are not necessary to the understanding or accuracy of the Censuses, may be included in a future project.
- Notes:
  - Census information published as part of a census is in scope even though such information describes non-official census data, e.g., data collection sponsored by the Massachusetts Historical Society (Nova Scotia in 1794).
  - The project will involve the creation of some new documentation that will improve discoverability of the collections.
  - Authority tables will be produced to clarify vocabulary used to identify specific censuses, census volumes, and geographies referenced in the censuses over time.  
<br />
4. **In scope: Only those Census contents which provide Census results or support the understanding and use of those results, are in scope at this time.**
- “Supplementary materials” In scope:
  - Anything not published as part of a census which provides valuable information to help use census data.
  - Classification  manuals (of, e.g., industries, occupations, standard geography) should be considered “part of” censuses. These are included as reference materials "key" to understanding and using the Censuses, even though they are not released as part of the Censuses. These reference materials may also include maps, research materials, and other.
- Note:
  - Supplementary materials do not include reference products that are published as part of the Census, or the official schedules / questionnaires, instructions to enumerators (these materials are already in scope).
- Out of scope:
  - Purely promotional contents are out of scope at this time.  
<br />
5. **In scope: For the older censuses (e.g. of New France or Western Canada/U.S.), two possibilities may be considered regarding the document’s geographic coverage.**
- In scope:
  - If the document in question covers more than the current national territory, then the document will be inventoried in the historical census materials (e.g.: aggregate data tables providing data for Newfoundland Colony / Quebec Colony and Miquelon Island).
- Out of scope:
  - If the document covers only a New France territory or another contiguous (with Canada) territory which is not currently part of the Canadian territory, then the document will not be inventoried in the historical census materials (e.g.: Louisiana (U.S.), St-Pierre and Miquelon (France), or northern Montana (U.S.))

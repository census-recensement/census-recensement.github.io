title: Phase 3 - Improving Access and Usability

The final phase of the project aims to address the situations where issues have been identified with the usability of the materials themselves. For example:

-	Most born-print census publications have been scanned, but the data tables within the publications are still not easily accessible. Extracting data tables from image files and migrating them to computer-readable formats (e.g. spreadsheet or text files) is one potential area of activity.
-	In the early era of born-digital census data (1960s-80s), many data tables were released in formats that are now obsolete. Migrating data into modern file formats is another potential area of activity.

As the project team fleshes out the project vision (summer 2020) we will be defining our goals for this phase of the project in more detail â€“ more information to come!

The platform will be an openly accessible website allowing users to search and browse the contents of the inventory. They will be able to search by subjects, geographies and dates, allowing them to easily identify a set of relevant materials. Access to digital copies of the materials will be facilitated by providing links out to the materialsâ€™ home repository.

The goal for the discovery platform is to be simple, visually appealing, and accessible to all in both English and French.
